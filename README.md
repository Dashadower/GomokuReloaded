# GomokuReloaded
MiniMand Monte-Carlo Tree Search based Gomoku playing agent.

Difference from GomokuBot:
- Usage of MCTS. Now this agent can use MCTS to decide an optimal move

- Genetic Algorithm in Evaluation Function. Genetic Algorithms have been used to optimize weights within the Evaluation Function

I was able to do a presentation at 8th KSCY, Yonsei University, 2018, "Implementation and Optimization of a Gomoku-playing Agent using Tree Searching"
