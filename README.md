# GomokuReloaded
My second attempt at creating a Gomoku agent.

Difference from GomokuBot:
1. I'm trying to implement the Monte Carlo Tree search method, instead of the alpha-beta.
It seems better, both time effeciently and performance wise.
1-1. Alpha-Beta Pruning with using machine larning techniques for the evaluation function is being considered.

2. Optimization and standarization of code.
GomokuBot's code is very messy, and extremely buggy. GR will have better support with other gomoku renders, and provide support with Gomocup Protocol.
